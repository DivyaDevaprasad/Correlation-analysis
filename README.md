# Correlation-analysis
Twitter is an online social networking service with over 300 million monthly active users. This enormous amount of data available on social media platforms can be extracted and analyzed for various purposes. In this paper, we aim to investigate the relationship between sentiment analysis of Twitter data and stock market prices for five companies (Walmart, ExxonMobil, Apple, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and Amazon) by scraping the Tweets extracted from Twitter based on company hashtags and using the twitter intelligence tool â€“ twint. Sentiment analysis is applied to the extracted tweets and a correlation is analyzed between stock market movements of a company and sentiments in tweets. Elaborately, news and tweets in social media about a company would encourage decision of people to invest or not in the stocks of that company and as a result, the stock price of that company would increase or fall. At the end of the paper, it is shown that a none or very weak correlation exists between the rise and fall in stock prices with the public sentiments in tweets
